Final Project for INFO 532 - Principles of Geographic Information Systems

The course introduces the use of geographic information systems (GISs) in the analysis of public health data. 
We develop GIS skills through homework and case studies, and particularly address basic GIS operations such as buffering, layering, 
and spatial queries as well as more advanced GIS capabilities such as geodatabases. In addition to GIS issues we address
introductory cartography, and basic statistical aspects of spatial analysis.
